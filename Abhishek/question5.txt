Question No.05

Difference Between push --force and push --force-with-lease is as follows - 

1.Both --force and --force-with-lease are options used with the git push command,but just difference is with safety.

2.push --force option allows us to forcefully push local changes to remote repository, even if it results in overwriting or deleting commits on the remote branch,
          but, In case of --force-with-lease, it ensures that you only force push if the remote branch expected state matches the local branch

3.eg. - git push origin main --force     AND    git push origin main --force-with-lease

In short, push --force-with-lease is the safe mechanism to push our code on Remote Repo.
